Another headed \"Marcus's Restaurant Success\" is signed by the CEO of a tech company. A third, promising \"Best Website Design\" with an AR preview feature, is credited to a generic-sounding \"founder\" with no findable business behind the name.\n\nThis isn't a one-off typo. It's what happens when an agency builds a demo template full of placeholder testimonials, sells that template to dozens of clients, and never goes back to swap the placeholder content for anything real. If the names, the businesses, and the headings don't line up on their own homepage — the page meant to be their best foot forward — ask yourself what corners got cut on yours."

You're looking at a template shop that optimizes for closing deals, not for maintaining what they sell.\n\nBefore you sign with any web agency, spend ten minutes doing exactly what we did here: read their testimonials for internal consistency, check their badges' dates, view their page source, and check their footer. If their own site can't pass that test, ask yourself why yours would."
